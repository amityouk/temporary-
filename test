100% decision/Branch coverage guarantees 100% statement coverage but not vise versa
retrospective means lesson learn from past 

Principal of Testing
================
1.Testing shows Presence of defects: Not assure you can find all possible defects in systems.no defect free product
2.Exaustive Testing is impossible:testing is not possible with all the possible data
3.Early Testing: Early Tesitng/Static Testing save time and money: Requirement,Desing and Code find defects as possible cause less cost.
4.Defect Clustering: Tester does not influence the outcome of previous module.Testing are indepedent on different modules
5.Tests Wears Out/Pesticide Paradox: same test repeated over a time with no longer help to find new defects so Testcases need to be regularly reviewed and revisit. 
6.Testing is context depedend:Two different software are tested with may be different Stratergy and approach
7.Absence of defect Fallacy:Meeting requiremet is equally important.finding defect and fixing doest not meet the user need and expectations.

Test Activities/Process(involve Stakeholdes/Teammember/Busineess domain/Technical factors/Project constraints/Organisazations factor/SDLC/Tools/Regulatory Requirements)
================
1.Test Planning: Defining the Test Objective and selecing the approach to achieve required goals-Tool, Resouces Entry and exit.
2.Monitoring and control: through out lifecycle, keep eye on going process, deviating obeserved by matricx and control acting will be taken
3.Test Analysis/what to test: Idetify the testable features and Define and priotize assocaite test conditions together with related risk and risk levels. Idenfy defects are related to contradictions,Imissions,Incosistency and ambiguities requirements.
4.Test Design/how to test : Writing Test Cases and other Testware, Identification of Coverage items, Guide to specife Testcase inputs
* Test data requirement
*designing the test env
*identifying any other required infrastrucutre and tools
5.Test Impementing: Ready for execution(Sequence of actions to be performed to run a test)
*creating or acquiring the testware necessary for execution eg test data
*manual and automate test scripts are created
*Test procedures are assembled into Testsuites and pritotized and arranged with in Test Execution
6.Test Excution: Running the Testcase
*Actual test result are compared with expected result
*Result are logged
7Test Completion summary report prepared by managers: It occur at project milestones eg end of iteration
*writing completion report and stoptesting and reporting to stakeholders
*writing report documenting defect with are open
*archive and store them and handover to appropriate maintainance team.


Testware(Documentaion Output of Test Activites) and TestRoles
===================
Testplanning : TestPlan include Entry and exit creteria documents, Test Schedule, Risk analysis outcome 
Test Monitoring and control : Tets Progress Report, risk informationa and control directives
Test Analysis: Test Conditions acceptance creterai and defect reports in the test basis
Test Design:Test Cases,Test Charters, Coveratge items, Test data reqirements and Test Env Requirement
TestImplementation: Test Procedure, automated test scripts,Test suits ,Test data, test execution schedule and test env elements eg drivers
Test Execution : Test logs and defect reports
Test Completion: document lession learned,Product backlog items or change request
Traceability: verify requirement are covered by testcase and can evaluate the level of residual risk
Test Manager Role: overall resposibilty of test Process, Test Team, Test Pkanning monitoring and control and Test completion
Tester: Test analysis,desing, testing and exection

Busineess Requirmet- Acceptance Testing Team Participate
System Requirement- System Testing Team Participate
Architecture Design or High Level Desing: Intergration Team Participate
Detailed Desing low level desing: Developement Team Participate

Shift left statergy or as soon as the  first draft is prepared tester is requested to participate and raise concert and refer as static testing.
TDD:Unit Test are Techically written first then code to satisfy the test and then test and code are refactored
ATDD:Derived test from acceptance criteria Test not technically written but helpfull in UAT. Test are written before the part of application is developed to stafiy the test
BDD:Derived test from requirements or behaviour Test are written from natural language which are easy to understand by stakeholders -Given/And/When/Then and directly translate to executable test
Devops: create synergy means “to work together” or “to collaborate.” Testing and operation work together to achive set of common goals supports Team autonomy,fast feedback, intergrated tool chanins,CI&CD.

benifits of devops: 
===============
1.encourage developers to submit high quality code by component test and static anylysis
2.fast feedback on code quality
3.Automation delivy through pipeline reduces the need for repetivie manua testing 
4. risk of regression is minimized due to scale and range of automated regression test
Disadvanatage
===============
pipeline must be defined and established, CI CD tools must be introduced and maintained,Automation require addition resources

Shift left approach
==================
1.Reviewing the Specifications from testing prospective to find defects such as ambiguities,incompleteness and inconsistencies
2.writing test before code and have a code run in a test harness(a collection of software and test data used by developers to unit test software models during development.) during code implementation
3.Using CI CD feedback fastere and automated component test accompany source code when submitted to repo
4.Completing static analysis on source code prior to dynamic testing as part of automated process.
5.performing non functional testing statrting at the component test level.this is form of shift left approvah as these non fucntional testing types are performed later in SDLC when complete system and representative test environment are available.
6.Shift left approach result in extra cost traning and efforts in earlier in process but expected to save efforts and cost in later process. it important for 
stakeholders are convinced and bought into this concept.
7.Retrospective is a meeting held between team members and stake holders hapening on weekly/end of project/release/iteration like scrum master bring out way of how things could done better or could be improve, how to prevent and recommendation, Process Improvement as a result should be recorded and normally part of test completion report and to refer in future release.

Test Level and Types
=======================
Every Test level must have a unique objective specific to that level.test activities can be performed at every test level or model
component/unit/program/class/code/structure/module testing first level: can be small part of application,a page,a functinality or a module. 
*it requires specifir support like test harness or unit test framework. 
*it performs by developer in their dev env and will be performed as white box testing approach.
*component integration and integration between two modules or with in module like city dropdown depend on state dropdown. component integration testing depend on integration statergy like botton down,top down and big bang approaches.
*system integration: two sytems itegration are perfomed by independent test team and might be require to address incomplete requirement and product risk
for eg amazon payment gateway itegrate with amazon application. it can be functional and non functional
*Acceptance testing: UAT done by customer to do acceptance testing/acknowledege the project before accepting the final product to ensure all the requirement are implemented 
Type of acceptance testing
UAT: functional level testing,Operation acceptance testing:ensure software installtion and operations and functionally work and contractual and regulatory acceptance testing : rules and regulations are meet like bikes, car  having rules non functional
Type of two sub levels of acceptance testing
Alpa: tested by coustomer obejective is to accept the product condocted in pre prod env and beta: conduct in real env done by Real users object is feedback from real users
* functional Testing/Unit Testing/Integration Testing/System Testing/Acceptance Testing the core features and Non functional Testing Performance stress load,usablity reliablity, maintainebility etc Testing the quality characteristics.
*white box/code/unit/system/structure/use backend testing done by developers bjective is to cover the underlying structure by the test to the acceptable level. and black box done on UI with no code and done by saperate testing team ,objective is checking system behavoiur against spec document 
*Confirmation/Restesting: when bug got fixed and Regression Testing only conduct when new changes are coming.
*Maintainance Testing: enhacement/improvement in existing application already in production/fixing known bug/new features may be user feedback. Impact analysis is tecnical study which help you understand that which area of application is impact for this change so that reduce of effort on amount of regression changes.scope of maitainace testing depends on
*degree of risk of the change
*size of existing system,
*size of change

Static Testing
=================
Static testing does not need to execute code, reviw on process specification, system architecture specification etc. if tes done manual ten call reviw if its done through tool then called static analysis. objective is detecting defects and accessing charactertics like readability, completeness, corectness etc.static analysis is incorporate with CI tools to detect code defects like spelling checkers define variable not use or variable no decleared

Activities of review 
=================
Planning, Review Initiation, individual review,communication and analysis and fixing and reporting.
Roles and resposibities
=======================
Manager:Decide what to review
Author: create and fix the product under review
Moderator/Facilitator: Ensure effective running of review meeting including time management and safe review env where everyone can speak
scribe/recorder:  record review comments 
reviewer: a subject matter expert will review and someone working on project
review leader: deciding who is involved and decide where review meeting takes place.

Types of review 
================
Informal:do not reqire formal document between two testers in a team.
walkthrough: is led by author creating doc generating new ideas motivating team etc
technical review: done my moderator objectinve is to make technical decision but also detect anomalies evaluate quality and build confidence
formal/inspection: in this all the complete generic meeting process will follow objective is to find the maximum number of anomalies evaluate quality,build confidence in product,metrics are collected and used to improve SDLC inspection can not be act as review leader or scribe.

Ch-4 Expreiecnce based technique can be apply in following worse situations.
1.Specification are poorly define can not apply black box technique.
2.Time pressure
3.Testing team is not formally trained for testing fundamentals.

Error Guessing/fault attack :domain knowledge, past experience etc. high level test cases or no test cases
===================
Error Guessing based on
1.how application has worked in past
2.what type of mistake that developer tends to make
3.failure that may have occur in application.

Exploratory Testing: poor specification or not detailed Requiments are missing or not clear. Exploring the product reuiremnt
===================
Test are simultaneously designed, exceute and evalute while the tester learns about the test objects.
This Testing is learn more about the test objects and to create test for untested areas.Test objective may be treated as high level test conditions.
Tester do not write test results  Tester give training session. Tester may use test session sheet to document the steps followed

Checklist Based Testing:A checklist is a questioneare put together to make a checklist which is used instead of test cases to test the system.
=====================
A Tester designs,implement and exeute test to cover test condition from a checklist
Checklist should not contain items that cne be checked automatically,items better suited for entry and exist criterai or items that are two general.
Checklist support various test type functional and non functional.care should be taken to avoid checklist become too long.c

Coolaboration based test approch
=============================
coloaborate user story writing have three crital aspects called together 3C's
*Card:the document describing the user story(Sticky notes, board)
*Conversation:explain how the software will be used(can be documented or verbal)
*Confirmation:the acceptance criteria.

Acceptance criteria: User story consider as done when we met the acceptance criteria accepted by stake holders.
======================
Acceptance criteria can be used to 
define e the scope of story
Reach consensum among the stakeholders
describe both positive and negative scenarios
serve as a basis for the user story acceptance testing
allow accurate planning and estimation
two types of acceptance criteria: most of the acceptance creteria are document is these formatsh
=================================
Scenario oriented: eg given/when/then used in BDD
Rule oriented: bullet points verificaiton list/table form or input/output mapping.

Acceptance Test Driven Developement: ATDD: Test are written first before development
===================================
Test cases are written prior to implementing the user story.test cases are created by team members with different propective eg customers,developers and testers.
Test may execute manually and automatically first step,
is specification workshop where user story(not yet defined) its acceptane criteria are anaylzed ,discussed and written by the team members incompleteness or defects in user story are resolved in this porcess.
Second step: create Test cases done by testers individually test cases are based on the acceptance criteria and can be seen as expample how software work. this will help the team to implement user story correctly.during the test design test techniques may apply.
ATDD follow below testcase approch
1.the First Test case are positive then team should perform negative test finally team should cover not functional test like efficency and usability. testcase should be expressed in way that should understand by stakeholders.
2.Test case covers all the characterstics of user story not beyond the story.it may contains the details of issue decribed in user story.
3.No two test case describe same characterstics of user story. the developers can autoamte the test case by writting the support code as they implement the feature describe by the user story. the acceptance test then become exeuctable requiments.

chapter 5 : Test Plan document- Responsibility of Test Manager
==============================
A Test plan describe the objectives,resources and process for a test project
1 It documents the means and schedule for achivieng the test objectives.
2.ensure that test will meet the established creteria
3.serve as mean of communication with team members and other stakeholders.

Test Plan should Include
========================
1.Context of testing(Scope,Test obejctive, test basis)
2.Assumption and constraints of test project
3.stakeholders(eg roles and resposibility, hiring and training need)
4.communication(forms and frequency of communication)
5.Risk Register(project and product risk)
6.Test Approch (Test Level, Test types, test techniques, entry and exit creteria,data requirement, test env requirement, deviations from organisation test policy and test stattery)
7.Bugdet and schedule(Running out of time is effect in project timeliness)

Release planning and sprint/iteration called as Agile methology

Release planning : looks a head to release of  product,define and redefine the product backlog and may break large user story in to small.it serve as bais of test approch and test plan. tester involves to write testable user stories and acceptance criteria, particiapte in project and quality risk analysis,estimate test efforts
,determine test approach and plan testing for release.

Sprint/iteration planning : looks a head for single iteration and with iteration backlog
Tester involve to breakdown user stores in to testing task,estimate test efforts for all testing tasks, identity and refine functional and non functional aspects of the test objects,determine the testablity of user stories.

Entry and Exit Criteria activities should have perform before to start and before to stop testing
========================
Entry Criteria/Definition of Ready include
=====================
availablity of resources(people,tools,env,testdata,budget and time)
availablity of testware(testbasis, testable env, userstories and testcases)
initial quality level of test object(all smoke tests have passed)

Exit Criteria/Definition of Done include
=====================
measuring of throughness(level of coverage, number of unresolved defects, defect desity, no of failed testcases)
complettion criteria(plan test have been excuted)
static testing have been performed
all defects found are reported
all regression tests are automated

Test Estimation Techniques decided by the test manager
=============================
Test effort estimation involve predicting the amount of test related work to meet the objective of test objects estimation of small teask is more accurate than large task. decompose into set of smaller task and then turn can be estimated

Test Estimation Techniques two types 
================================
1. Metrics based estimation
a.)Estimation based of ration: its metrics base technique and estimation based on ratio-taking an existing project as refrence and ration use their to estimate new  eg if the previous project development to test ratio was 3.2 and cuurent project dev efforts are 600 person-days the test estimated to be 400 person-day
b.)Project Extrapolation: its metrics base technique are made early as possible in the current project to gether data this method is very suitalbe for iterative SDLC eg the team may extrapolete the test efforts in the forthcoming iteration as the averagred effort for the last three iterations).
2.Expert Base estimation(wide band delphi and three point estimation)
a.)wide band delphi/planning poker: Expert based techinique each expert is isolated and estimates the efforts. estiame are usually make using cards wiht number that represent the effort size.
b. Three point estimation: in this Expert based techinique three estimation are made by experts i.e the most optimistic, the most likely and the most pessimistic 
E= (a+4-m)+b/6 eg if estimate in person hour  a=6 m=9 and b=18 then E = 6+4*9+18/6 =10 so final estimate 10+-2
